## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository by using `git clone git@github.com:davidauza-engineer/portrait_api.git`.

### Install

1. Move to the root directory of the project by using `cd (path of the project)`.
2. Run `bundle install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec rails db:create` to create the databases needed.
4. Run `bundle exec rails db:migrate` to migrate the databases.

### Usage
